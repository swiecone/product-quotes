Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to translated versions, but also spawning localized
versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena. Allusions are also sometimes made to
his use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his large amount of body hair with specific regard to his
beard, and his role in the action television series Walker, Texas Ranger.

## Usage

```shell
# Retrieve all quotes
$ curl --request GET \
       --url 'https://api.productquotes.io/' \
       --header 'accept: application/json'


```

Example response:

```json

    {
        "quote": "this is the first quote I created",
